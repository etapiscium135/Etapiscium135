<h2><strong>Crepes Origin</strong></h2>
        </p>
        <p><em>
           These delicate pancakes are known as ‘crêpes’ in France. Their name comes from Old French ‘crespe’ which traces back to the Latin ‘crispa’ or ‘crispus’ which means curled. This probably refers to their often slightly ruffled edges. A French café that specializes in crepes is known as a crêperie. In Brittany, they still prefer crepes made with local buckwheat flour and use the slightly derisive ‘crêpes de froment’ to refer to crepes made with white flour.

<h2><strong>Ingredients</storng></h2>
</p>
<p><em>
   <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
 <li>2 eggs</li>
 <li> ½ cup milk</li>
 <li>½ cup water</li>
 <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
 <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
</em></p>

<p>
<h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
</p>

<p><em>
<li>Step 1
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>

 <li>Step 2
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>

<li>Step 3
Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
